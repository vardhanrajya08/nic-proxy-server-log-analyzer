# psl-analyzer 

psl-analyzer is a cyber security project aimed at analyzing and visualizing proxy server logs for the Information Security department. It provides insights into network traffic, security incidents, and user behavior based on the log data.

## Features

- Perform various analysis tasks on the log data, such as:
  - Aggregating and counting log entries by different attributes (e.g., source IP, destination IP, action).
  - Filtering and searching logs based on specific criteria.
  - Generating statistical reports and visualizations (e.g., bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs).
- Export analysis results in different formats for further analysis or reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Used for server-side scripting and handling log data processing.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for storing and querying log data.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for creating the user interface and visualizations.
- **JavaScript** and **Plotly**: JavaScript library for interactive and dynamic chart visualizations.
